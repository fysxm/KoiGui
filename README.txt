Hello. You just downloaded KoiVM protector with helpful GUI that makes your work easier :)
There are some infos about it, how to use it and another stuff...

What's KoiVM?
-It's a powerful virtualizing protector for .NET assemblies developed by Ki(github.com/yck1509). It's a plugin
for popular open source obfuscator ConfuserEX(github.com/yck1509/ConfuserEX). You can find all of it's files in
folder called "koivm" in this folder. I used modified version of KoiVM by Trollicus(github.com/Trollicus/KoiVM)
with some improvements :)

What's virtualization?
-Virtualization is a powerful software protection technique. KoiVM's .NET virtualization engine converts MSIL
instructions to it's own that are only understandable by KoiVM virtual machine, so it stops any decompiling, because
it completely hides original code. However, virtualized assemblies have slower performance and the file size is larger.
Virtualized assemblies can also false trigger antivirus, because the file is obfuscated.

Is it free and open source?
-Yes, but the original KoiVM was paid, but the source has been leaked, so now you can use KoiVM for free :)
All KoiVM components aren't obfuscated with the GUI program too, so you can modify them, decompile them only for YOUR OWN
PURPOSES. Do not resell, rent, lease or make money from them. Also, do not use this software and it's component for
illegal purposes(malware spreading, malware protection). I DON'T TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY USAGE OF THIS SOFTWARE AND
DAMAGES CAUSED BY IT.

How to use it?
-Run KoiGui.exe in this folder. Now select base directory with file(s) you want to protect and output directory, where
the protected file(s) will be saved. It automatically selects output directory by this rule: base directory + directory named
Virtualized. You can change output directory too, if you don't want the default one :). Now select the module that will be
protected. It automatically takes you to chosen base directory. YOU CAN SELECT ONLY ONE FILE! If you've done all of this steps,
click on "Virtualize!" button. Command prompt window will appear. DO NOT CLOSE IT! It will close automatically after finishing.
This can take while if the assembly is big, so you need to wait a while :)

What do you find here?
-There are 4 items in this directory. KoiGui.exe(GUI program), README.txt(this file), Bunifu_UI_v1.5.3.dll(UI components for
GUI program) and directory called koivm(All the protection stuff). DON'T DELETE, RENAME OR MOVE ANY OF THESE FILES/DIRECTORIES,
OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT WORK!

Enjoy :)
